# Dependency Management {#dependency_management_title}

Laravel is not built from scratch. It is built on top of several frameworks and libraries. You can see the list of other libraries it uses [here][dependencies-laravel]. It is also powered by [Illuminate components][illuminate]. All of these components are combined by making sure each of them can be treated and written as a composer [Composer library][comp-lib]. These libraries are hosted in public repositories.
