## Build your own Homestead {#custom_homestead_title}

Homestead comes with pre-installed software. If you want to customize the installed software, you will need to have access to the scripts that is used to build Homestead itself. This project is called ["Settler"][settler-url]. You can check the source code of that project to have a better understanding of how Homestead was built, and probably add your own scripts as well.
