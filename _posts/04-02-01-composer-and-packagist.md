## Composer and Packagist {#composer_and_packagist_title}

By default, Packagist is used as a package repository and GitHub to download the files itself. But you can define your own repositories by setting up your own [Satis][satis] mirror of packages. Although you can use any class or even plain php functions inside Laravel (as long as it can be autoloaded). This is not a recommended practice. Make your own [Composer library][own-composer] for each application specific set of classes and include it as a dependency in the composer.json file.
