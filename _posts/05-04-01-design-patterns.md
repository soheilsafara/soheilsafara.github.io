## Design Patterns {#design_patterns_title}

It is easy to mess up your Laravel application if you don't have any sort of pattern to follow. The following design patterns are recommended for those who are building an application with Laravel or want to refactor their existing projects:

* [Domain Driven Design][ddd-url]
* [Don't call Eloquent models directly, Use Repositories!][repo-url]
* [Inversion Of Control Container and Dependency Injection][ioc-url]
* [SOLID Principle][solid-url]
