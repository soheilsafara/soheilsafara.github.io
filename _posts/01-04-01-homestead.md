## Homestead {#homestead_title}

Laravel is not only using Vagrant as the official development environment but also has its own base box called "Homestead". 
You can use Homestead to start developing with Laravel without the hassle of setting up your local environment for Laravel.

The instructions and usage of homestead can be found in the [Official Documentation][homestead-docs].
